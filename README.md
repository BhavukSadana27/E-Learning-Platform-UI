DESCRIPTION :


A **responsive, single-page educational website** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed to introduce an e-learning platform where users can explore courses, learn about the platform, and get in touch.

###  Features

* **Hero section** with a welcoming headline and call-to-action button (`Get Started`).
* **Courses section** displaying featured courses like Web Development, Data Science, and UI/UX Design.
* **About section** briefly describing the platform’s mission.
* **Contact section** with a clean form for user messages.
* **Header navigation** for smooth in-page links.
* **Footer** with copyright.

---

###  **Styling Highlights (CSS)**

* Modern flat design with a clean blue theme (`#007acc` as primary color).
* Flexible **responsive layout** with `flex` in `.course-list` to wrap course cards nicely on different screen sizes.
* Subtle card design: white backgrounds, light borders, and rounded corners.
* Consistent spacing and typography for readability.
* Simple button hover and focus states.

---

###  **How It Works (JavaScript)**

* `Get Started` button shows a quick `alert` popup.
* Contact form uses `onsubmit` with a simple function to prevent default behavior and simulate form submission.

---

###  **Tech Stack**

* HTML5
* CSS3 (no frameworks)
* Vanilla JavaScript

---

### **Responsive Design**

* The site adapts to different screen sizes: courses wrap automatically; the form and sections remain centered and clean on mobile.
